      <h1>Welcome to my</h1>
      <h1> <span class="orange">Artificial</span> WebHome!</h1>
      <p>I’m a web designer and ongoing developer and also a photographer living in Dhaka Bangladesh.I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And also learning back end languages like JAVA.I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p>
      <p>A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a Computer Science Engineering  student cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading James Rumbaugh or Jhankar Mahbub, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.
